## Kubernetes/Container Engine Visualizer

MJE NOTE: This is a fork of k8s-visualizer by Felix Ortmann (0ortmann). Please to refer to the original repository for the official upstreams. All credits to the respective authors. I've just been mainly tweaking spacing values to move flowcharts to the left and closer together. Also changed labels in script.js to select OpenFaaS functions by default (although you still need to add a label '''faas_function=\<func-name\>''' to the OpenFaaS function services)

This is a simple visualizer for use with the Kubernetes API.

### Usage:
   * First install a Kubernetes or Container Engine Cluster
   * ```git clone https://github.com/0ortmann/k8s-visualizer.git```
   * ```cd path/to/k8s-visualizer```
   * ```kubectl proxy -p 8080 -w .```

In your browser you can see the visualization at localhost:8080/static

### Aim of this fork:

It may not be practiable to you to freely change labels on rcs or services. This script enables you to configure what labels should be used for visualization. Its better human readable.

### Configuration:

In order to use this script, you will have to configure what resources shall be displayed. 

The visualizer uses labels to organize the visualization. In particular it expects that

   * pods, replicationcontrollers and services you want to visualize can be classified by a ```label``` (eg. 'tier': 'backend')
   * associated pods, replicationcontrollers and services have shared ```label``` with the same value (eg. 'application': 'app-name')

### Examples:

Lets assume you have 3 apps in your system, with the labels ```'application': 'app-{1,2,3}'``` and all three live in the ```'backend'``` tier.


Lets assume your replicationcontroller and service definitions look similar to the following:

Replicationcontroller
```
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "ReplicationController",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "app-1-9999999999"
    },
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 5,
        "selector": {
            "application": "app-1"
        },
        "template": {
            "metadata": {
                "labels": {
                    "application": "app-1",
                    "tier": "backend"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Service
```
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Service",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "app-1",
        "labels": {
            "application": "app-1",
            "tier": "backend"
        },
    },
    "spec": {
        "selector": {
            "application": "app-1",
        }
    }
}
```

Then you would have to configure the script (at the bottom) as follows:

```
// accepts multiple values like {key: "key", value: "value"}
var renderLabel = [{
    key: "tier",
    value: "backend"
}];

// identify connected resources by this labels value  (must be set!)
var connectionIdentifier = "application"; 
```


This will make the script visualize all those resources that define a label ```tier``` with the value ```backend``` and it will connect all those resources, that share the value of the label ```application``` (which would result in connecting the rc, service and pod(s) of app-1, app-2 and app-3, grouping it into 3 logical groups)
